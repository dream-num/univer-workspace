description: Create, edit, inspect, and review remote Univer Workspace documents with the uvw CLI (npm package univer-workspace-cli). Use for connecting an agent to Workspace, finding Personal or Team Space files, and completing document tasks through Worktrees. Not for local .univer files handled by univer or for embedding the Univer SDK in an application.

# Univer Workspace CLI

This is the discovery entry for the remote Workspace CLI. Detailed commands, Facade APIs,
and verification guidance come from the installed CLI's version-matched operational Skills.
Use the user's chosen Workspace service and task scope; do not substitute the local `univer` CLI.

## Set up the connection

Check whether `uvw` is available before installing it. If missing, install it in the environment
where the agent runs:

```bash
npm install --global univer-workspace-cli@latest
```

The package is `univer-workspace-cli`; it provides the `uvw` command (and `univer-workspace-cli` as
the same program). **Never** run `npm install -g uvw` or `uvw-cli`: those are unrelated third-party
packages. After upgrading from an older version, re-run
`npx skills add dream-num/univer-workspace --skill univer-workspace-cli -g` once so this Skill matches
the new command names.

The default service is `https://space.univer.ai/`. Preserve an existing configured origin unless
the task targets another service. For a user-specified deployment, configure its actual origin;
never run the placeholder literally:

```bash
uvw config set workspace.origin <origin>
uvw auth status --json
```

If authentication is needed, start browser-approved login:

```bash
uvw auth login --json
```

Give the user the returned verification URL and code, then stop and wait for their reply.
Do not poll or run the completion command while approval is pending. After the user confirms
approval, exchange it once:

```bash
uvw auth login --complete --json
```

Do not request the user's password or copy browser cookies into the CLI. If completion fails,
use the returned diagnostic; do not loop or infer approval from elapsed time.

## Load operational guidance

Before operating on Workspace content, read the installed core Skill:

```bash
uvw skills get core
uvw skills list
```

Load the relevant Unit Skill before authoring: `sheet`, `doc`, `slide`, `base`, or `board`.
For other content, load `blob` for original-file transfer/replacement or `html-view` for live
HTML pages. Load `embed` or `cross-unit-formula` when composing Units, together with the
source and host Unit Skills.

```bash
uvw skills get sheet
uvw skills get <name> --full
uvw skills read <name> <resource-path>
```

`skills get` lists available reference paths and read commands. Read the references needed for
the task, or use `--full` to include all bundled references and templates. Do not depend on a
repository checkout, guessed installation paths, or a different CLI version's API examples.

## Complete the task

- Name the repository as `-R <owner>/<slug>` (`<username>/personal` is a Personal Space) or set
  `UVW_REPO`; find it with `uvw repo list`. Discover the intended file with `uvw space find`; use
  returned IDs rather than treating names as IDs.
- A pull request is a Worktree (`uvw pr ...`; `uvw worktree ...` is the same). For a new editable
  Unit task, create a new one with `uvw pr create`. Reuse a known one only to continue that same task.
  Content commands take `--worktree <id>`, the `id` from `uvw pr view <n> --json id`. Read-only inspection does not require creating a task draft.
- Follow the loaded Skills to author and verify. Read back stored content; inspect rendered
  output when appearance matters. A successful command alone is not verification.
- When the user points at an Issue ("work on #12"), read it with `uvw issue view 12 -R <repo> -c` first; the installed
  core Skill describes the Issue workflow.
- Mark it `uvw pr ready` and hand off the verified result with its review URL (`uvw browse <n>`).
  Leave `pr merge` or `pr discard` (irreversible) to the user's decision unless the user has explicitly authorized that action.
- Blob and Space organization writes are direct operations, outside Worktree review. Follow
  their operational guidance rather than implying a Worktree can undo them.

## Diagnose and upgrade

Use `uvw <command> --help` for installed syntax. Exit code 4 means sign-in is required. If setup or a runtime failure blocks the
task, report the concrete issue instead of bypassing the Workspace workflow.

When an upgrade is needed, finish active work before installing the newer package with npm.
This CLI has no `update` command. After upgrading, reload core and the relevant operational
Skills so the guidance matches the installed version.
